<p>Hello, I'm Abdirahman Hassan Abdullahi, a recent petroleum engineering graduate with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. <br />It's been about two and a half months since I earned my degree, and I'm currently on a journey of exploration.While I'm currently unemployed <br /> in the petroleum industry, I've found a new fascination with coding.
<p>I believe that coding is the language of the future, and I'm committed to honing my programming skills to open doors to exciting opportunities.<br /> My transition from petroleum engineering to the world of coding is driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to contribute to the ever-evolving <br /> tech landscape.</p>
<p>I'm excited to learn, adapt, and collaborate on new projects in the coding field. My journey has just begun, and I'm eager to see where this path <br /> takes me.</p>
<p>Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!</p>
